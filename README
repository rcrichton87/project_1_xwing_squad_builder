The first project in CodeClan's 16 week learn to code course, we were required to create a website in one week with the following requirements/restrictions:

The project must be built using only:

Sinatra
PostGRES SQL
HTML / CSS
Ruby

It must NOT use:

Any Object Relational Mapper (e.g. ActiveRecord)
JavaScript.
Authentication

My brief was to create a Squad Builder for the X-Wing tabletop game:

Create a web app with ships, upgrades and pilots, which can be added to a squadron for a particular faction.  It should be possible to save and retrieve squadrons from the database, add news ships and upgrades to the database, and add new pilots to ships.
